## Overview

In the past two years, there were various Shiny focused workshops introducing basic as well as advanced topics such as modules and Javascript/R interactions. However, handling advanced user interfaces was never an emphasis.   Clients often desire custom designs, yet this generally exceeds core features of Shiny. We recognized that R App developers lacking a significant background in web development may have found this requirement to be overwhelming. Consequently, the aim of this workshop is to provide participants the necessary knowledge to extend Shiny's layout, input widgets and include the new components in a novel modular framework. The workshop is organized into four parts. We first dive into the {htmltools} package, providing functions to create and manipulate shiny tags as well as manage dependencies. We then go through the basics of JavaScript, especially jQuery. Part 3 homes in on the development of a new template on top of Shiny by demonstrating examples from the [{bs4Dash}](https://github.com/RinteRface/bs4Dash) and [{shinyMobile}](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile) packages, part of the [RinteRface](https://rinterface.com) project. Finally, we integrate these new components into shiny modules, designed with an object-oriented-based package, namely [{tidymodules}](http://opensource.nibr.com/tidymodules/index.html). This novel approach allows the development of Shiny apps using R6 classes, thereby significantly reducing the burden of modular communication faced by classic shiny modules and their namespace management.


## Learning objectives

- Manipulate Shiny tags with {htmltools}
- Understand how dependencies are handled
- Discover the steps to create a new template from scratch
- Learn how shiny deals with inputs
- Discover a new framework for robust module development


## Prerequisite

- Be familiar with Shiny, modules
- Basic knowledge in HTML and JavaScript is a plus


## Is this course for me?

You should take this course if you answer yes to at least 2 of the following questions:

  - Do you want to know how to develop outstanding shiny apps?
  - Have you ever wondered how to develop new input widgets?
  - Are you bothered by the cumbersomeness of module communication in vanilla Shiny?
  - How would you manage an app with 150 tightly connected modules?
